## 📈 PERFORMANCE METRICS

Each agent is tracked on:
1. **Task Completion Rate** - Tasks completed vs assigned
2. **Code Quality Score** - Based on reviews and tests
3. **Collaboration Score** - Team interaction effectiveness
4. **Response Time** - Check-in punctuality
5. **Blocker Resolution** - Speed of unblocking issues

---

## 🔧 AGENT CAPABILITIES

All agents have access to:
- GitHub repository and branches
- ChromaDB vector database
- MongoDB for persistence
- WebSocket communication
- OpenAI API (through Aurora team)
- Docker containers
- Testing frameworks
- CI/CD pipelines

---

## 📌 IMPORTANT NOTES

1. Each agent works on their own branch
2. Team leads coordinate merges
3. Prometheus handles conflicts
4. 20-minute check-ins are mandatory
5. RED alerts trigger immediate response
6. All code must pass tests before merge
7. Documentation is required for all features

---

## 🚀 INITIALIZATION COMMAND

To activate all agents simultaneously:
```
INITIALIZE ALL AGENTS
```

This will:
1. Activate all 32 agents
2. Distribute 147 tasks
3. Start 20-minute check-in timer
4. Open communication channels
5. Begin 36-hour countdown
